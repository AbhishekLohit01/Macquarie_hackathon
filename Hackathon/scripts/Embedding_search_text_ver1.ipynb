       "'Assets under management at 31 March 2024 were $A938.3 billion2, up seven per cent from $A878.6 billion at 31 March 2023, largely due to favourable market movements, investments made by MAM Private Markets-managed funds and favourable foreign exchange movements, partially offset by assets no longer managed as a result of a reduction of co-investment management rights. MAM delivered a net profit contribution of $A1,208 million, down 48 per cent from $A2,342 million in FY23. The result was primarily driven by lower asset realisations in green investments and increased net expenditure in investments in green energy portfolio companies operating on a standalone basis with base and performance fees broadly in line. BFS delivered a net profit contribution of $A1,241 million, up three per cent from $A1,201 million in FY23. The result reflected growth in the loan portfolio and BFS deposits11, and credit impairment reversals primarily reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook; partially offset by margin compression, higher employment expenses and increased technology investment to support portfolio growth, compliance and regulatory requirements. CGM delivered a net profit contribution of $A3,213 million, down 47 per cent from $A6,007 million in FY23. The overall result reflected substantially lower inventory management and trading income from a strong prior year in North American Gas and Power and a decreased contribution from Commodities risk management, primarily in EMEA Gas and Power, and Resources due to lower client hedging as volatility and price movements stabilised across commodity markets following record highs in the prior year. Commodities income of $A3,516 million was up six per cent on the year ended 31 March 2022 (FY22). Financial Markets had an increased contribution on the prior year with continued strong performance across major products and markets, particularly in foreign exchange and interest rate products, and an increased contribution from the Futures business. Macquarie Capital delivered a net profit contribution of $A1,051 million, up 31 per cent from $A801 million in FY23. The result reflected higher investment-related income driven by growth in the private credit portfolio, lower credit provisions and net impairment reversals, which was partially offset by lower net gains on investments including the non-recurrence of material asset realisations and lower advisory fee income.'"

Markets-facing activities, which are undertaken by Macquarie Capital and most businesses in CGM, delivered a combined net profit contribution of $A3,699 million, down 40 per cent on FY23, which was notably characterised by exceptional levels of volatility in commodity markets that drove a record FY23 performance from CGM. Net operating income of $A16,887 million was down 12 per cent on FY23, while operating expenses of $A12,061 million were broadly in line with FY23. International income accounted for 66 per cent of Macquarie’s total income. The income tax expense of $A1,291 million was down 29 per cent on FY23 and the effective tax rate was 26.8 per cent8, up from 26.0 per cent in FY23. The higher effective tax rate was mainly driven by the geographic composition and nature of earnings. At 31 March 2024, the Group employed 20,666 people9, which was up one per cent on 31 March 2023. In addition, approximately 236,000 people were employed across managed fund assets and investments10.'"
